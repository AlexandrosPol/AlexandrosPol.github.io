### [Abalone Age Prediction](https://github.com/AlexandrosPol/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Abalone%20Age%20Prediction/Abalone%20Dataset%20-%20linear%20regression%2Bpca.R)
Applied linear regression and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements.

### [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/AlexandrosPol/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction.ipynb)
Analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict survival rates using machine learning in Python. The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of classification algorithms.

### [Card Deck - Image Classification](https://github.com/AlexandrosPol/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Card%20Deck%20-%20Image%20Classification%20with%20PyTorch/card-deck-image-classification-with-pytorch.ipynb)
This project involves classifying images of playing cards into their respective categories using deep learning. The dataset consists of images of playing cards, and the task is to correctly identify the rank and suit of each card. The project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. The model is trained using a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained network from the timm library, specifically designed for image classification tasks.
